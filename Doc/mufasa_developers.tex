\chapter{Introduction}

This is the Simba / MML (Mufasa Macro Library) documentation, aimed at
developers. The document will take several different approaches in treating and
explaining Simba / MML internals. We will first discuss the general 
structure of a particular subject, and if necessary, spent a few sections
on files linked with the subject. 
As Simba depends heavily on the MML and the MML can also actively be used in 
other languages, we will first discuss the MML, and then turn to Simba.
