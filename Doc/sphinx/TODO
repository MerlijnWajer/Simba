# Change a minus to a plus when something is being worked on.
# Remove it when you are done.

# GENERAL

- Run spellcheck before you commit (make sure you ignore section names
  and the like).
- Remove small/extraneous pages (merge them as a section with another or
  mark that you will add stuff to them).
- Create some conventions. Capitalize Simba whenever it occurs, and pick
  either color or colour (it'd probably be best to use color, as the code
  seems to use it).
- Find stuff to add to this list.

# ADDING CONTENT

- Expand "Troubleshooting"
	- And its subsection.
- Expand "Feature Overview"
	- And its subs. There's like nothing in them, those are the type
	  of pages I was talking about. Combine them under feature overview?
