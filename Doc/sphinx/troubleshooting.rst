Troubleshooting
===============

This is a general troubleshooting page and will hopefully cover all potential
problems you may encounter. Before you read any further, make sure your Simba is
up to date. See :ref:`updater`.

Where is the DTM Editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DTM Editor a Simba Extension. See :ref:`simbaext` for more information on
extensions and how to enable the DTM editor.

Where are my Extensions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All extensions are in the *Extensions* folder. If this folder is empty, you may
need to manually download the Extensions or reinstall Simba. If you have
downloaded a recent Simba (0.97.3 or higher), you will also have an Extension
Updater Extension (you read that right!), make sure to enable this extension as
well.
