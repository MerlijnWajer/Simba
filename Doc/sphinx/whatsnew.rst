What's new in Simba?
====================

Currently Simba is still in its beta stages; this includes the documentation.
You will probably notice some parts of the documentation aren't finished or are just
plain missing. 

Simba is being updated almost every day. To see changes as they are added, view
http://git.villavu.com/?p=simba.git;a=summary. Each commit should be explained
tersely in one line, and the exact changes can be viewed with "commitdiff".

A list of new features since 750 will show up here eventually.
