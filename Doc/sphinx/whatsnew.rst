What's new in Simba?
====================

Currently Simba is still in its beta stages; this includes the documentation.
You will probably notice some parts of the documentation aren't finished or are just
plain missing. 

Simba is being updated almost every day. To see changes as they are added, view
https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/Simba. Each commit should be explained
in one line, and the exact changes can be viewed with "commitdiff".
