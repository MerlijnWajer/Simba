TMOCR Class
===========

The TMOCR class uses the powerful ``ocrutil`` unit to create some default but
useful functions that can be used to create and identify text. It also contains
some functions used in special cases to filter noise. Specifically, these are
all the ``Filter*`` functions.

How the filtering works internally is extensively documented in the code itself
and therefore won't be documented here.
