Documentation TODO
==================

*   **WIP** - What's New. Changelog template added, fill it with stuff.
*   *Wizzup* - Script manager (non technical).
*   *Wizzup* - Script manager (technical).
*   Extend "Getting Started". Include downloading scripts from the manager.
*   think of good chapters for the complete tutorial. (it should teach basic
    stuff, not document all features. script reference is for that purpose)
*   write a lot more chapters for simba references. There's plenty to document.
*   write working with files for scriptreference (or any other chapter)
    It may be useful to check http://wizzup.org/simba/article/4
*   Features -> Perhaps (interactive) images?
*   Scripting reference:
        -   Files
        -   Bitmaps
        -   DTM
        -   Internet

*   Expand "Troubleshooting"
	    - And its subsection.
*   Expand "Feature Overview"
	    - And its subs. There's like nothing in them, those are the type
	      of pages I was talking about. Combine them under feature overview?
