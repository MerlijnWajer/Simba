Documentation TODO
==================

*   *Wizzup* - Script manager (non technical).
*   *Wizzup* - Script manager (technical).
*   Extend "Getting Started". Include downloading scripts from the manager.
*   think of good chapters for the complete tutorial. (it should teach basic
    stuff, not document all features. script reference is for that purpose)
*   write a lot more chapters for simba references. There's plenty to document.
    It may be useful to check http://wizzup.org/simba/article/4
*   Features -> Perhaps (interactive) images?

*   Expand "Troubleshooting"
        - And its subsection.
*   Expand "Feature Overview"
        - And its subs. There's like nothing in them, those are the type
          of pages I was talking about. Combine them under feature overview?
*   Write lots of examples.

    -   How to use file functions.
    -   How to use DTM functions, etc.

*   Add a section with examples of stuff that is often done / used.
