*   bugreport. Put general ``rules`` for commiting bugs in there.
    What to report, what not to report, 
    check if a bug already exists, what info should be
    added, etc.

*   whatsnew. it's still very short, we could probably add some of the latest
    features. perhaps some info about the script manager.

*   script manager (non technical) I (wizzup) will do this myself

*   script manager (technical) I (wizzup) will do this myself

*   extend getting started. this probably requires some script manager stuff

*   think of good chapters for the complete tutorial.

*   write a lot more chapters for simba references. There's plenty to document.


* Expand "Troubleshooting"
    - And its subsection.
* Expand "Feature Overview"
	- And its subs. There's like nothing in them, those are the type
	  of pages I was talking about. Combine them under feature overview?
