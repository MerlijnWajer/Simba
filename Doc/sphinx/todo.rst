*   *Wizzup* - Script manager (technical).
*   Extend "Getting Started". Include downloading scripts from the manager.
*   think of good chapters for the complete tutorial. (it should teach basic
    stuff, not document all features. script reference is for that
*   write a lot more chapters for simba references. There's plenty to document.
*   write working with files for scriptreference (or any other chapter)


* Expand "Troubleshooting"
	- And its subsection.
* Expand "Feature Overview"
	- And its subs. There's like nothing in them, those are the type
	  of pages I was talking about. Combine them under feature overview?
