What Is Simba?
==============

Simba is a program used to repeat certain (complicated) tasks. Typically these
tasks involve using the mouse and keyboard. Simba is programmable, which means
you can design your own logic and steps that Simba will follow, based upon
certain input.

This "input" can vary greatly; from data in files to colors and text on the screen.

..  This needs more info
    yep
    Not really, you basically covered what Simba is in the above paragraph.

Simba can:
    *   Find and read colours on the screen.
    *   Click or move the mouse to a specific position on the screen. Typically
        this is the position of a found color or bitmap.
    *   Read and write files.
    *   Connect to the internet to read websites and post data to them.
    *   Read text on the screen and turn it into actual text. (Optical Character
