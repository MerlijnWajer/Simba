Getting started with Simba
==========================

This page will help you install Simba and point you at some basic Simba
features.

Installing Simba
----------------

Installing Simba is pretty straighforward and will only take a couple of
minutes.


.. _simba-installer:

Simba installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone can download Simba at http://wizzup.org/simba/
Go to download, and download the Simba installer.

Once it is done downloading, simple run the installer and follow the steps.

.. note::
    Simba will install to C:/ by default; if you want to install it
    somewhere else, make sure you select a different location in the installer.

Once you have installed Simba, make sure you update it at least once, 
to get a more recent version of Simba. 

Simba will tell you there is an update and an update button will appear.
Alternatively you can update Simba using Tools -> Update.

.. note::
    Updating Simba regularly is recommended.

Simba binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is harder and not recommended. Steps on how to do this will follow later.

For now, simply stick to the installer and update
Simba after the install has completed.

Setting up SRL 4 with Simba
---------------------------

If you were using the :ref:`simba-installer` then you can simple enable the
``SRL Updater`` extension. (Go to View -> Extensions and enable srl.sex)

This is the only supported way. You can simply do a svn checkout on the srl
repository, but if you can do that, then you should be able to set up SRL
yourself as well.

Installing scripts
------------------

Scripts can be downloaded with the Script Manager, in Tools -> Script Manager.

.. note::
    The Script Manager is not finished yet.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you run into problems that are not mentioned here, make sure you check out
the :ref:`Troubleshooting` page.
