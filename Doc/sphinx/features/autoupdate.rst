Updater in Simba
================

As soon as there is an update for Simba, an extra icon will appear in the icon
bar. If you click it, an update window will appear. Click *update* and Simba
will update itself. Note that you will have to restart Simba to use the updated
version.

Alternatively you can use Tools -> Update to update.
