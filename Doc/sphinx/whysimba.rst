Why Simba?
==========

GEWOON MAN

    *

      Programmable
      In fact, the only way to use it, is to write a program that Simba will execute.
    *

      Extensible
      Simba supports both plugins in machine code as well as extensions written in the Simba programming language. (Pascal)
    *

      Free (As in Free Beer and as in Freedom)

      Simba is 100% free to use. In fact, we welcome you to share it with the rest of the world.

      The source code to the program is also freely available, under the GPL license.
    *

      Reliable
      Simba is actively maintained by a team of knowledgable programmers. We as a team do our best to make Simba into a quality product. However: this does not guarantee a bug free program. (Bug free programs don't exist)
    *

      Cross Platform

      Simba has been written with freedom in mind and believes Simba should not be limited to one platform, as that limits its users to one platform as well. Currently the supported platforms are Windows and Linux.

      Even though we try hard to make Simba bug-free on all platforms, some issues remain. The biggest issue is the component that executes your program. It is an external component and does not play too well on Linux. Hopefully we will be able to fix this soon.

      Quite fast
      The Simba developers have designed and written Simba with speed in mind. However, focussing too much on speed is in reality not a good case. It often leads to instability and more bugs in the program. For Simba, we have sacraficed some speed to make a more featureful and stable program.
