    -   General ideas:
        -   everything subprocedure (lots of code)

        -   jit + comparison function (per cts)  generated, call in loop

        -   comparison function (per cts), not generated, call in loop

    -   Investigate SIMD probable speedups                          [ ]
    -   JIT (Generate comparison functions)                         [ ]
    -   Comparison functions for HSL/XYZ/L*a*b should check for
        match on each component before calculating the next.

    -   Pass color information in struct                            [ ]
